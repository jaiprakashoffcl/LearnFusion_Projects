## Speech Recognition Module

**Description:**
This Python script demonstrates the implementation of speech recognition functionality using the SpeechRecognition library. The script acts as a basic voice-controlled application capable of understanding and executing simple commands.

**Installation:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
   ```
3. Make sure you have a working microphone connected to your system.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script.
2. The application will greet the user and wait for a command.
3. Speak commands such as "open Google" or "play music" to interact with the application.

**Example:**
```python
python speech_recognition_app.py
```

**Note:**
- Ensure your system's microphone is properly configured and functional for accurate speech recognition.
- Experiment with different commands and customize the script to suit your needs.

**Future Improvements:**
- Implement additional functionalities such as opening specific applications, performing web searches, or controlling smart home devices.
- Enhance error handling to provide better user feedback in case of unrecognized commands or microphone issues.
