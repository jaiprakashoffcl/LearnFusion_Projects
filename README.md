# LearnFusion Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python script implements a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified limit.

## Project Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This script provides a clear and efficient way to generate this sequence in Python.

## Functionality

- **Fibonacci Sequence Generation:** The `fibonacci(n)` function calculates and returns a list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length `n`.
- **Input Validation:** The function ensures the user-provided input `n` is a positive integer.
- **Error Handling:** Informative error messages are provided for invalid input.
- **Code Clarity:** The code is well-structured with clear variable names and comments to enhance readability.

## Usage


### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaiprakashoffcl/LearnFusion_Projects.git
```

**Use code with caution.**

### Run the Script:

Navigate to the project directory and execute the script:

```bash
python LearnFusion_Fibonacci_Generator.py
```

**Use code with caution.**

The script will prompt you for the desired sequence length. Once entered, the generated Fibonacci sequence will be printed to the console.

### Example

**Input:**

```
Enter the desired sequence length (positive integer): 10
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Dependencies

This script requires no external libraries and is compatible with standard Python installations.
